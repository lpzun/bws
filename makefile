# Generic C Makefile

# We assume by default that every .c file depends on *all* .h files in
# the current directory.  The rationale is that it is close to impossible
# to keep track of the true dependencies (think of: x.c incl. a.h
# incl. b.h!). Having too liberal dependencies can cause weird seg faults.
# Having too strict dependencies only causes too much re-compilation.

# 1. Public Region. The following settings are useful for compiling a     #
# single executable file out of many source files (*.c). If the directory #
# contains many independent files to be compiled to independent           #
# executables, use SOURCES=$(BASE).c, HEADERS=$(BASE).h.                  #
# See an example in EXAMPLES/makefile-local-vars.                         #
